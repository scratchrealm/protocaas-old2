# Here's the reason that all the other Python files are in ../api_helpers
# I was noticing very long build times (~15 minutes)...
# Apparently, vercel treats every .py file in /api as a lambda function.
# So it was building each and every one of them, even though index.py should be the only one.
# See https://github.com/orgs/vercel/discussions/46
